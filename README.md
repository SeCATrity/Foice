# *Foice*: Can I Hear Your Face? Pervasive Attack on Voice Authentication Systems with a Single Face Image

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of *Foice*.

*Foice* is a generative text-to-speech model that generates multiple synthetic audios from just a single image of the personâ€™s face, without
requiring any voice sample.



## Dependencies
* face_alignment `pip install face-alignment`

## Pre-trained models
| Face-dependent Voice Feature Extractor  | Face-independent Voice Feature Generator |

## Voice generation

Foice reuses the synthesizer from SV2TTS. You can find the pre-trained synthesizer using the [link](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning).
