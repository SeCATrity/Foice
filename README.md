# *Foice*: Can I Hear Your Face? Pervasive Attack on Voice Authentication Systems with a Single Face Image

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of *Foice*.

*Foice* is a generative text-to-speech model that generates multiple synthetic audios from just a single image of the personâ€™s face, without
requiring any voice sample.
